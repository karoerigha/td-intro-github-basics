Describe the process of committing a project to github repository.     
                 Firstly we have to go to our github account and create a new repository,and give it the same name with the folder you're opening the repository for,then you use a text editor to open your local file,then you go back to your github and under the code, you'll see instructions for you to follow and they're as follows. If it's your first time ,you'll need to initalize git with the "git init" and you can do this using a command line.I'll suggest you use visual studio code because there is a terminal for that.Then you have to add your project to git with git add file or you can just put git add . Next you have to do your first commit with  git commit -m first commit. After commiting you can always use git status to check if you're good to go.
